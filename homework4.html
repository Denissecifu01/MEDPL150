  <p>
    This photomontage, <strong>Forgotten Futures</strong>, centers on a personal photograph of my niece to highlight the everyday hardships children face in my homeland — 
    especially the lack of clean water and limited access to schooling. I juxtaposed the portrait with imagery of background sand since back home all you see is desert and 
    not many streets of concrete, along with a repeated sad face to represent the emotions these children feel daily due to the lack of resources.

    These children have been forgotten by the government and don’t receive the proper education or even enough clean water that every child deserves. However, they always remain proud 
    of their culture and traditional clothing. Despite the circumstances, they find ways to enjoy their childhood and play among one another.

    I blended images using <strong>Layer Masks</strong> to control where textures appear and <strong>Adjustment Layers</strong> (Curves and Hue/Saturation) to unify tone. 
    I used the <strong>Overlay</strong> and <strong>Multiply</strong> blending modes to bring the drought texture into the scene while keeping the subject visible, 
    and I reduced saturation for a somber mood. The cracked earth texture forms the layer behind them, combined with ripped notebook pages and a clock — symbolizing 
    the passing of childhood time without access to proper education.
