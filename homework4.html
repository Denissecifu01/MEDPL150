 <p>
    This photomontage,Forgotten futures, centers on a personal photograph of my niece to highlight the everyday hardships children face in my homeland.
      Especially lack of clean water and limited access to schooling. I juxtaposed the portrait with imagery of cracked earth and an sadness face to represent the physical and educational scarcity that 
      shape these childhoods. These children have been forgotten by the government and don't receive the correct and real education that all children deserve to get. However these kids are happy kids that no matter the situation they always find
     a way to enjoy their childhood.

    I blended images using Layer Masks to control where textures appear and Adjustment Layers (Curves and Hue/Saturation) to unify tone. I used the <strong>Overlay</strong> and <strong>Multiply</strong> blending modes to bring the drought
      texture into the scene while keeping the subject readable, and reduced saturation for a somber mood. Image credits: personal photograph (my niece on the right); cracked earth texture which is the layer behind them, ripped notebook pages.The clock that 
      represents the time of their childhood and how time passes by and they have not received a good education.
