    This photomontage,Forgotten futures, centers on a personal photograph of my niece to highlight the everyday hardships children face in my homeland.
      Especially lack of clean water and limited access to schooling. I juxtaposed the portrait with imagery of background sand since back home all you see is dessert and not much streets of concrete, and an sadness face repeatedly to represent the feelings that 
       these children back home feel everyday due to the lack of resources. These children have been forgotten by the government and don't receive the correct and real education or even enough water that all children deserve to get. However these kids are are always proud of their culture and their traditional clothing, and no matter the situation they always find
     a way to enjoy their childhood and play among each other.

    I blended images using Layer Masks to control where textures appear and Adjustment Layers (Curves and Hue/Saturation) to unify tone. I used the <strong>Overlay</strong> and <strong>Multiply</strong> blending modes to bring the drought
      texture into the scene while keeping the subject readable, and reduced saturation for a somber mood. Image credits: personal photograph (my niece on the right); cracked earth texture which is the layer behind them, ripped notebook pages.The clock that 
      represents the time of their childhood and how time passes by and they have not received a good education.
