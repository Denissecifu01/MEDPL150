  <p>
    This photomontage, <strong>Forgotten Futures</strong>, focuses on a personal photograph of my niece to highlight the everyday hardships children face in my homeland, especially the lack of clean water and limited access to schooling. I combined the portrait with imagery of desert sand and repeated sad faces to represent the emotions these children experience daily due to the lack of resources.

  <p>
    Many children are overlooked by the government and do not receive proper education or sufficient clean water, yet they remain proud of their culture and traditional clothing. Despite these circumstances, they find ways to enjoy their childhood and play together.

    I blended images using <strong>Layer Masks</strong> to control where textures appear and <strong>Adjustment Layers</strong> (Curves and Hue/Saturation) to unify tone. The <strong>Overlay</strong> and <strong>Multiply</strong> blending modes helped bring the drought textures into the scene while keeping the subject visible, and I reduced saturation to create a somber mood. Cracked earth textures, combined with ripped notebook pages and a clock, symbolize the passage of childhood without access to proper education.
