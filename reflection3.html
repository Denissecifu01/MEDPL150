  <h1>Reflection on Homework 3</h1>

  <p>
    Working on this assignment gave me a better understanding of how photography is not only 
    about what you capture with the camera but also about how you choose to present it afterward. 
    Taking the photos for shallow and deep depth of field really helped me notice how much focus 
    can change the mood of an image. With the shallow depth photo, the background almost disappeared, 
    which made the subject pop and feel more important. On the other hand, the deep depth photo reminded 
    me how the environment can play a big role in shaping the meaning of the subject. Both approaches 
    showed me that technical choices like aperture and focus can completely change the story an image tells.

    Editing the images in Photoshop was also eye-opening. Using the Field Blur tool made me realize 
    how much control I actually have over directing someoneâ€™s attention. Something as simple as a 
    garbage bin, which we normally ignore, became the center of attention once the background was 
    blurred out. The Camera Raw Filter before-and-after was another moment where I could see how 
    small adjustments in color and lighting make an image feel sharper, cleaner, and more professional.

    Overall, this assignment made me more aware of the choices photographers and editors make to guide 
    viewers. I learned that even everyday objects can become meaningful subjects if you frame and edit 
    them with intention.
