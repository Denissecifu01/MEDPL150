  <h1>Deep Depth of Field</h1>

  <img src="images/imagedeep.jpg" alt="Dark chair in the middle of a hallway" width="600">

  <p>
    This photo shows a single chair placed in the middle of a hallway, captured with a deep depth of field. 
    Unlike the shallow depth example where the background fades away, here every detail in the hallway remains sharp and visible. 
    The darker tone of the chair contrasts against the brighter surroundings, which makes it stand out as the subject 
    while still keeping the environment an important part of the image. 
    I like how the hallway feels like it stretches out into the distance, giving the photo more context and depth. 
    The effect shows how a deep depth of field can capture both the subject and its setting, 
    creating a more complete picture of the scene.
