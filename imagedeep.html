  <h1>Deep Depth of Field</h1>

  <p>
    This photo shows a dark-toned chair in the middle of a hallway, captured with a deep depth of field. 
    Every detail of the hallway is visible and sharp, unlike a shallow depth of field where the background 
    would blur. The chair stands out because of its darker tone, yet the surroundings also remain important 
    to the composition. The effect makes the space feel larger and adds a sense of context to the subject.
