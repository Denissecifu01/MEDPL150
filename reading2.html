    </body> Nesrine Malik cautions in her essay that we are being overloaded with what she refers to as "AI slop"—a deluge of mass-produced, low-cost visual content that undermines our ability to discern reality from fantasy. 
    It's interesting how According to Malik, AI slop frequently harbors unconscious biases that support regressive power systems, such as nostalgia, idealized forms, and sanitized historical accounts. 
    That is, instead of being a neutral technology, AI turns becomes a vehicle for the uncritical smuggling of ideologies into the public awareness.The way Malik presents the issue as one of excessive noise rather than a lack of content really got my attention.
    The algorithm promotes emotionally charged, low-effort content,drawing users further into skewed visual worlds even for media-literate people who try to filter properly.That notion connects with my own work in photomontage and visual media. In creating images that combine real photographs with symbolic textures, 
    masks, and blending modes, I’m constantly engaging with the tension between representation and manipulation. In my montage about child poverty, I tried to make visible the suffering of children who lack water and education.But Malik’s critique reminds me that visual work can also mislead or anesthetize: especially if overdone, 
    blending or filters could soften the harshness, or the manipulation becomes an aesthetic so strong that it overshadows the message. The task, then, is to preserve authenticity and moral urgency within an inherently mediated medium.
