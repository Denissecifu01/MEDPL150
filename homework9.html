    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I decided to focus on college students’ sleep habits because it is something almost everyone in my class can relate to. I created a google form survey and asked my classmates about how many hours of sleep they get, what time they usually go to bed, and how rested they feel when they wake up. After collecting the responses, I organized the data and looked for patterns that could tell a clear story visually.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Illustrator, I chose to use a combination of bar graphs and a pie chart to represent the information. The bar graph on the left shows the average hours of sleep, the pie chart in the center focuses on bedtimes, and the bar graph on the right shows how rested students feel. Most classmates reported sleeping between six and seven hours, going to bed between midnight and 1 a.m., and still feeling somewhat tired in the morning. I used these three points to highlight the main idea of my visualization: students are sleeping, but maybe not enough to feel fully rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      I selected a soft color palette with pastels to keep the design calm and connected to the theme of night and rest. Using the grid and guides in Illustrator helped me align each graph and keep the layout balanced across the 1920×1080 artboard. Overall, this project showed me how design choices like color, spacing, and graph type can make data easier to understand and more engaging to look at.
