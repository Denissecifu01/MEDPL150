    <h1>Reading 3:Graphic Novel:Motherhood in Crisis</h1>

        As I read the grpahic Novel Motherhood in crisis , it made me think deeply about the emotional 
    and social challenges that mother's face. Especially the moment in which their responsibilities collide with their identities. 
    The graphic novel creates this visual element of the story. It includes illustrations, the colors and the symbolism. Thanks to all these elements the author is able to 
    show the tension that is felt during the novel. What really stood out me the most was how the images communicated what words often fail to capture. The silent moments of guilt or the anxiety that the mother feels during her experience in motherhood. 

        It's interesting how this narrative doesn't try to romanticize motherhood but instead it puts out there the crisis women feel when trying to balance on society expectations and even in their own personal needs too. It was such a powerful graphic novel by the way 
    the story explores themes like identity loss, or the emotional labor. Also, the author uses the use of visual metaphors, such as fragmented body parts or faded colors, which really highlighted the most on how motherhood can sometimes feel like a constant negotiation between care for others and 
    the care for themselves. Me as a reader, did appreciate how the graphic novel gave the space to reflect on the emotional reality of being a mother. It really made me think on how society should offer more empathy and support to women going through these experiences. Overall Motherhood in crisis is very visually and emotionally 
    impactful, showing that motherhood is survival, resilience and identity all at once.
