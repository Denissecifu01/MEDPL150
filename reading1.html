  <h1>Reading 1 — Reflection on Susan Sontag’s *On Photography*</h1>

  <p>
    In the reading of <em>On Photography</em> by Susan Sontag, I was able to analyze how she uses Plato’s famous allegory to explain how photography works when it comes to shapes and how it gives different perspectives on life. It was very interesting to read about.

  <p>
    Sontag suggested that photographs can make us viewers feel kind of “trapped,” like in a literal cave. Growing up, my parents would always film every special moment ever since I was a newborn, and to be honest, having the possibility of going over those videos again makes me feel so grateful.

    One of Sontag’s main points that stood out to me was how photographs contain a small concept of reality and how we interpret that reality, all based on the details added to each photograph. She also mentions how people feel they know something about an image just by looking at it, even if they’ve never experienced it in real life.

    I was able to connect with this point because there have been moments when I scroll through Instagram and see someone posting about their culture and how they celebrate—and automatically, I feel connected to their culture. Another interesting point that Sontag mentioned was how we take pictures of events or moments to prove we went through them.

  <p>
    I honestly feel like unconsciously I do that all the time. I remember this summer traveling to one of my dream places in Italy—I literally took a picture of every place I went and everything I ate. It was amazing, and I came back to New York to show my family everything I did and all the new towns I visited.

  <p>
    It’s like we take pictures of our moments to later show “proof” that we lived through them. The image becomes proof of that memory. Lastly, towards the end of the reading, Sontag points out that just like there are images that are important for us, there are also images that are important for society. For example, the tragic event of 9/11—many images were taken that will forever stay in our history.

  <p>
    Images like the Twin Towers burning or people covered in ash walking through the streets asking for help didn’t just capture what happened, but they also define how history recalls this tragic event. Another example, not so far from today, was the Coronavirus pandemic. Images captured the city and how empty the streets were, as well as exhausted doctors and nurses who tried their best every day to save people’s lives.

  <p>
    This reading really made me think differently about photographs and how a simple image can hold so many meanings. It made me more aware and intentional when capturing a moment next time.
