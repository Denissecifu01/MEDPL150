  <h1>Reading 1: Susan Sontag, <em>On Photography</em></h1>

  <p>
    In the reading of <em>On Photography</em> by Susan Sontag, I was able to analyze how she uses Plato’s famous allegory to give an explanation on how photography works when it comes to shapes and how it gives different perspectives on life, which was very interesting to read about.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sontag suggested that the many photographs can make us viewers feel kind of “trapped,” like in a literal cave. Growing up, my parents would always film every special moment ever since I was a newborn, and to be honest, having the possibility of going over those videos again makes me feel so grateful.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was interesting how one of Sontag’s primary points was that photographs contain a small concept of reality and how we interpret that reality, all based on the details added to each photograph. She also adds that people often feel they know something about an image just by looking at it, even if they’ve never experienced it in real life.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was able to connect with this idea because there have been moments where I scroll through my Instagram and see someone posting about their culture and how they celebrate — and automatically, I feel connected to their culture. Another interesting point that Sontag mentioned was how we take pictures of events or moments to prove we went through them.
  </p>

  <p>
    I honestly feel like unconsciously I do it all the time. I remember this summer traveling to one of my dream places in Italy — I literally took a picture of every place I went and everything I ate. It was amazing, and I came back to New York to show my family everything I did, everywhere I went, all the new towns I visited.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s like we take pictures of our moments to later show “proof” that we lived through them. The image becomes proof of that memory. Lastly, towards the end of the reading, Sontag points out that just like there are images important to us personally, there are also images important for society. For example, the tragic event of 9/11 — there were many images taken that will forever stay in our history.
  </p>

  <p>
    Images like the Twin Towers burning, or people covered in ash walking through the streets asking for help, didn’t just capture what happened — they also define how history recalls this tragic event. Another example, not so far from today, was the Coronavirus pandemic. Images captured the city and how empty the streets were, as well as exhausted doctors and nurses doing their best every day to save people’s lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    This reading really made me think differently about photographs — how a simple image can hold so many details and meanings for us. It made me more aware and intentional when capturing a moment next time.
