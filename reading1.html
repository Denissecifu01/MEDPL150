    <h1>Reading 1: Susan Sontag, On Photography</h1>
   
    <p>
      In the reading of On Photography by Susan Sontag, I was able to analyze how she uses Plato’s famous allegory to give an explanation on how photography works when it comes to shapes and how it gives different perspectives on life. Which was very interesting to read about. 
    Sontag suggested that the many photographs can make us viewers feel kind of “trapped” like in a literal Cave. Growing up, my parents would always film every special moment ever since I was a newborn, and to be honest having the possibility of going over those videos again makes me feel so grateful. 
    It was interesting one of Sontag primary points of how photographs contain a little concept of reality and how to interpret that reality. All based on the details added to each photograph. She also adds on how people feel they know something about an image by just looking at it, even if they have never experienced it in real life. 
    I was able to connect with this primary point because there have been moments where I scroll through my Instagram and someone posts about their culture and how they celebrate and automatically I feel like I connected with their culture. Another interesting point that Sontag mentioned was how we take pictures of events or moments to prove we went through it.
    I honestly feel like unconsciously i do it all the time. I remember this summer traveling to one of my dream places in Italy, I literally took a picture of every place I went, everything I ate. It was amazing and I came back to New York to show my family everything I did, everywhere I went, all the new towns I went to. 
    It’s like we take pictures of our moments to later show “proof” we lived through it. The image becomes proof of that memory. Lastly, towards the end of the reading Sontag points out how just like there are images that are important for us, there are images important for society. For example, the 9/11 tragic event. There were many images taken that will forever stay in our history. 
    Images like the Twin Towers burning, or the people all covered in ash walking through the streets asking for help. All the images didn’t just capture what happened, but I feel like they also define how history recalls this tragic event. Another example, that isn’t so far from today, was the Coronavirus Pandemic. Images captured the city and how empty the streets were. 
    The images captured also exhausted doctors and nurses that tried their best every day to save people from dying from this pandemic. This reading really made me think differently about photographs, and how a simple image can have so many details and what they mean for us. This reading made me be more aware and intentional when capturing a moment next time.
