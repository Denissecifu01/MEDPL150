  <p>
    For this image, I used Photoshop’s Field Blur tool to keep the garbage bin in focus 
    while softening the background and surroundings. The blur effect removes distractions, 
    which makes the bin the clear subject of the photo. What’s interesting is how an 
    everyday object we normally ignore suddenly becomes the center of attention. 
    By blurring out everything else, the bin feels more significant than it would in real life.
