  <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
  <p>
    Creativity has always been a big part of who I am, even if I didn’t always have the right tools to express it. I’ve always liked the idea of telling stories through images and design because it feels like another language that connects people without needing words. Since I’m bilingual, I think a lot about how language and culture shape the way we see the world, and I want my creative work to reflect that. Whether it’s through visuals, colors, or the way something is put together, I want my projects to feel like they carry pieces of my identity while also connecting with others.

    In this class, I want to challenge myself to actually put my ideas out there and not be afraid to experiment. I look up to artists and designers who make simple but powerful work, and I want to find my own style that feels authentic. I like mixing photography, writing, and design, and I’m excited to see how those elements can come together in web projects. At the end of the day, I just want my work to be honest and meaningful, something that reflects me but also invites others to see a part of themselves in it.

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Setting up this site was definitely a new experience for me. At first, GitHub felt confusing because I wasn’t sure how everything connected—like repositories, commits, and publishing the actual page. There were moments when I felt stuck, especially when the site wasn’t showing up the way I expected. But little by little, I started to understand that web development is really about small steps adding up. It taught me that even if something looks complicated at first, it becomes manageable if I break it down and take my time.

    What I found interesting is how hands-on this process is. I realized that building a website isn’t just about the technical side; it’s also a creative process where I get to decide how my work is presented. I hope to get more comfortable with HTML and design so that by the end of this course, I can create pages that feel professional but also reflect who I am. Overall, even though it was a little stressful in the beginning, I’m proud that I was able to get my first page online, and I’m excited to see how much I’ll grow from here.
