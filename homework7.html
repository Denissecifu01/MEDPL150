  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    I chose this mountain view because its quiet scale and layered ridgelines always make me feel both peaceful and grounded.
    To reinterpret the scene I simplified complex details into bold, geometric shapes and divided the composition into a clear foreground, middle ground, and background.
    I limited the palette to a triadic set of three colors to unify the piece while keeping strong visual contrast between planes. Using only flat vector shapes emphasized form and rhythm over texture, which helped me highlight the sceneâ€™s natural structure. 
    Overall I wanted the illustration to communicate calm strength and a simplified, graphic memory of the original landscape rather than a literal copy. This image was taken by me in Ravello, Italy. Such a beautiful View of the moutains and the ocean.
