    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I created a vector illustration of an eye using Adobe Illustrator just like shown with the professor during lab time. I focused on the eye color being a light blue. I used light colors because I feel like it grabs more attention for the person observing the eye illustration.
      I used more than two basic shapes like circles and ovals, and also used tools like the Pen tool and the Direct Selection tool as well.

      I did have a little hard time when creating the lashes of the eye, but I eventually got it. This homework helped me better understand how minimal design and colors can work together to create emotion. 
      I also practiced a lot with layer organization, grid alignment, and line styling, which made the design process more structured. It was very fun and interesting to see how expressive and creative vector art can be with simple tools and limited elements.
