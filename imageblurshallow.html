  <h1>Photoshop Field Blur</h1>

  <p>
    For this image, I used Photoshop’s Field Blur tool to keep the garbage bin as the main point of focus while softening everything around it. 
    The blur makes the background less distracting, which helps the viewer’s eyes go straight to the bin. 
    What I like about this effect is that it takes an ordinary object, something we might overlook every day, 
    and turns it into the clear subject of the photo. The surroundings fade away, almost like they don’t matter, 
    and the bin stands out in a way it normally wouldn’t.It shows how editing can completely change the way we look at simple things.
